At the cost of storage of an extra iterate and gradient, these algorithms achieve better performance and cheaper computation than the classical steepest-descent method. We indicate a convergence analysis of the method in the two-dimensional quadratic case. The behaviour is highly remarkable and the analysis entirely nonstandard.}",
